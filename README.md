# E-Store

Welcome to the **E-Commerce Store** project! This web application allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, apply discount codes, and proceed to checkout. It is built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, ensuring fast and efficient page loads while providing a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React-based framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety to the project, helping avoid potential bugs and improving code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework to style the application.
- **React Context**: Used to manage the global state of the cart across the app.
- **Node.js**: Backend technology for handling API requests (via Next.js API routes).

## Features

- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their cart from the product listing page.
- **View Cart**: Users can view the items theyâ€™ve added to their cart with product details like price, quantity, and total cost.
- **Remove Items from Cart**: Users can remove individual items from their cart.
- **Clear Cart**: Users can empty the entire cart in one click.
- **Coupon Code**: Users can apply discount codes like **SAVE10** for discounts.
- **Checkout**: The app simulates a checkout process where users can review their cart before proceeding.

## Usage

Once the app is running locally, users can access the following features:

1. **Shop Page**: Displays a list of products available for purchase. Users can click "Add to Cart" to add items to their cart.
2. **Cart Page**: Users can view the products added to their cart, change the quantity, remove items, or apply a coupon code for a discount.
3. **Checkout Page**: Displays a review of the cart and a simulated checkout process.

To start using the app:

2. View the cart to see added products, their prices, and quantities.
3. Apply any discount codes, if available.
4. Complete the checkout process by reviewing the cart and simulating a purchase.
